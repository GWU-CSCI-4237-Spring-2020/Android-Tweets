    This is similar to the strings.xml file, except we only put sensitive API keys (e.g. Google's keys) in this file.
    This allows us to also add this file to our .gitignore file to avoid checking it into GitHub.

    Generally you would NOT check your API keys into GitHub, but I'm doing it to allow the students
    to use the lecture app without getting their own key.
